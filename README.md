**Urban Sprawl Analysis Report for Calgary**
This repository contains the data, analysis, and visualizations for a comprehensive study on urban sprawl in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The report examines the patterns and impacts of urban sprawl on the city's growth dynamics, land use efficiency, infrastructure demands, and environmental sustainability.

**Data Sources**
  •	Land use maps from 2011 and 2024 from the city of Calgary 
  •	Population data from 2011 and 2024 from the city of Calgary and statistics Canada
  •	Spatial analysis and quantitative data interpretation

**Methodology**
A mixed-method approach was employed, combining spatial analysis, quantitative data interpretation, and literature review. The analysis focused on four key indicators of sprawl:
  •	Spatial growth trends
  •	Transportation and infrastructure challenges
  •	Environmental impact and land use efficiency
  •	Housing affordability and socioeconomic consequences

**Key Findings**
  •	Calgary's urban expansion from 2011 to 2024 resulted in an 18% increase in residential land area and a 37.95% decrease in undeveloped land area.
  •	The city's population grew by 53.2% during the same period, with a significant increase in population density.
  •	Urban sprawl has led to increased land consumption, car dependency, and environmental challenges, while failing to address housing diversity and equitable access to transit.

**Recommendations**
To promote sustainable urban development, the report recommends:
  •	Implementing growth boundaries to restrict urban expansion into undeveloped areas
  •	Promoting transit-oriented development to reduce car dependency
  •	Enhancing housing diversity to address affordability and minimize sprawl
  •	Preserving green spaces to maintain ecological integrity
  •	Adopting land use incentives to prioritize compact, sustainable development

**Repository Structure**
This repository contains the following folders:
  •	data: Contains the raw data used in the analysis
  •	visualizations: Contains the visualizations and maps created for the report
  •	report: Contains the final report document
